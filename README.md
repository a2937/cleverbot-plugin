AvaIre BotLibre
================

AvaIre BotLibre is a simple plugin that adds the [BotLibre]((https://www.botlibre.com/) chat bot service to the AvaIre Discord bot.

## How to Use

> **Note:** This assumes you're already self-hosting Ava, this plugin won't do anything on its own!

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/a2937/avaire-botlibre/releases) off github and place the `.jar` file within the plugins folder.
2. Start up Ava to make Ava recognize the plugin.

And you're done!
